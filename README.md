# Data Structures Assignments - Northwestern Polytechnical University

## Acknowledgement

The project is updating.

## Project Overview

This project contains reference implementations for both lab assignments and theoretical coursework in the Data Structures course at Northwestern Polytechnical University. It aims to provide clear code examples to help students understand fundamental data structures and their implementations.

## Directory Structure

```
/ Root Directory
│── labx/      # Reference solutions for lab assignments (e.g., lab1, lab2)
│── hwx/       # Solutions for theoretical assignments (e.g., hw1, hw2)
│── *.cpp      # Common data structure implementations
│── *.h        # Header files
│── README.md  # Project documentation
```

### 1. Lab Assignments (`labx`)

The lab assignment directory (`lab1`, `lab2`, ...) includes a series of implementation exercises covering:
- Linear lists (arrays, linked lists)
- Stacks and queues
- Trees and binary trees
- Basic graph operations

### 2. Theoretical Assignments (`hwx`)

The theoretical assignment directory (`hw1`, `hw2`, ...) contains answers and explanations for coursework questions, such as:
- Algorithm analysis and complexity computation
- Properties and optimizations of data structures
- Implementation of specific problems

### 3. Common Data Structures (`*.cpp`, `*.h`)

The root directory contains standalone implementations of common data structures, including:
- Linked List (`linked_list.h`)
- Sequence List, Stack and Queue (`sequence_list.h`)

## Usage Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone http://1.13.156.137:8099/haomingbai/ds_lab.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory and compile example code:
   ```sh
   cd ds_lab
   g++ -o a lab1/a.cpp -std=c++11
   ./a
   ```

## Environment Requirements

- Language: C++
- Compiler: GCC / Clang / MSVC
- Compatible with Linux / macOS / Windows

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit pull requests or open issues for discussions.

## Disclaimer

This project serves as a learning reference only. Do not submit the provided code as your coursework. If using it for study purposes, ensure you understand the logic and implement it independently.

## 关于数据结构实验

记得避雷网络空间安全学院的王亮. 这B人TM给我83分, 我不知道这人怎么给的分数, 合着我这么多代码白写的呗, 和TM那帮上课不来的坐一桌.

煞笔王亮, 只要他不回我邮件, 我就把这一段放在这里.
